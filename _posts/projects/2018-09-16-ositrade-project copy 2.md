As a Blockchain developer, my mission was to take over the Ositrade app in collaboration with IBM Montpellier and ensure the technical management and follow-up of the project until it was put into production on IBM Cloud. This mission allowed me to develop skills in project management, Devops (CloudFoundry), CI & CD, Blockchain (HyperLedger Fabric), NoSQL (Cloudant)
