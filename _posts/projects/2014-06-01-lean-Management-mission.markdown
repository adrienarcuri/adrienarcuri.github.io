We achieved a 2-months lean management mission for [ACSP Metrologie](https://www.acsp-metrologie.fr) with my colleagues Lalia DIALLO, Loris MATTEI and tutored by Marie RIMLINGER.

The scope was the following :
- delivering value and optimizing work processes by applying lean management methods like VSM (Value Stream Mapping), BPMN
- catch and write specifications of the new information system needs
