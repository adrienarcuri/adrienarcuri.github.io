With [Neda Lestarevic][1], we participated in the [HACKING COVID 19][2] hackathon whose goal is to find ideas and solutions to face the coronavirus crisis serenely. We created MonPetitCovid.

[MonPetitCovid][3] offers to make children and families aware of the behaviors to adopt in the event of a viral epidemic, to prepare companies to maintain their activity in the event of a health crisis and to help victims of COVID19 by providing them with financial support and assistance.
