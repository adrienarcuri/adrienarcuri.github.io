In february 2017, we participated to the world IBM/Capgemini Blockchain Hackathon with a remote company team from Montpellier, Nantes and Marseille. The goal was to design and develop a Proof of Concept on the following subject "Payment Instruction" in bank sector using Hyperledger Fabric V0.6. It was a very great and challenging moment as project leader !
