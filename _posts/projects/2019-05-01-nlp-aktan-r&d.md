Within Aktan's Research and Development, we work on the topic of automatic word processing through software prototypes for the analysis of emotions in texts.

As a data engineer, I proposed a text modeling using a graph database called JanusGraph.
After that, I also design and develop a micro-service and a REST-API whose objectives were to process and analyze the output data of the Language Processing Pipeline with the language Python3 (notably the Pandas and Flask libraries).
