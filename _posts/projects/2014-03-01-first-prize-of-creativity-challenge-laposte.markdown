[Mines Alès - CREATIVITY CHALLENGE](https://wwwmedias.mines-ales.fr/pages/apprenez-differemment) is a competition where a group of students take on a challenge from large companies. The best ideas are rewarded with prizes and valued in companies.

During 1 month, with other students, we worked for [La Poste - Le Lab Paris](https://www.labpostal.fr/) on the following subject : ``` Connected mailboxes and sharing economy ```.

Our team finished first of the challenge by designing a new idea of service of connected mailbox linked to a mobile app.


The team was composed by Adrien ARCURI, Clément VIROT, Kevin REVILLON, Benjamin ARTERO-GAILLARDO
