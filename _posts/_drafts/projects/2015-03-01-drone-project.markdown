The aim of this mission was to apply the principles of image processing in order to fly an AR drone remotely following lines or curves.

This project was a 2-months academic R&D mission in collaboration with [Quentin LE SCELLER](http://lesceller.com/) and tutored by [Phillipe MONTESINOS](http://www.lgi2p.mines-ales.fr/~montesin/).
