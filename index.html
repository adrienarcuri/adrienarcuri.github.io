<section class="section-presentation">
  <h1>👨‍🔬 Who am I</h1>
  <p>
    I am a curious engineer-manager from France who wants to work on scientific issues that meet the emerging global
    challenges
    of the next 15 years such as stability of governance systems, climate change, environmental protection, and the
    evolution of agriculture and health. Structured and organized, I believe in success by example, sharing knowledge
    and effectiveness by collective intelligence.
  </p>
  <h1>📜 The beginning of the story ...</h1>
  <p>
    In 2015, after completing my 2nd year internship in engineering school in Prague on the <a
      href="{{base.url}}/projects/2015/05/01/recognition-movement-public-transport.html">recognition of the movements
      of users taking public transport</a>, I did an apprenticeship program in Capgemini TS in Montpellier as I.T
    student engineer for 1 year. At the end of the apprenticeship, I was graduated with <a
      href="{{base.url}}/education">Master’s Degree in Engineering and Management of Complex Systems</a> and hired as
    a software engineer in the same company on behalf of banking clients and insurers.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2016, when my agency manager proposed a blockchain project to me, I was immediately interested in this
    innovative technology, much more than in the virtual currency aspect.
    Positioning allowed me to begin my work in coordinating a remote team for a <a
      href="{{base.url}}/projects/2017/02/01/blockchain-hackathon.html">blockchain hackathon</a> and few times after I
    was jumping in a blockchain project for a bank in Paris with an european team.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then in 2018, I joined Aktan - a service design company - to manage and develop a <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGNCeDK01_0&t=18s">blockchain project in agriculture</a>. After completing
    it, I moved on new issues around the automatic processing of languages and emotions...
  </p>
  <p>
    Then in 2020, I had the opportunity to become Project Tech Lead at Klanik to automate a Disaster Recovery process
    !

  <p>I'm discovering Dart and Flutter in order to develop Mobile, Desktop, and Web applications !</p>
