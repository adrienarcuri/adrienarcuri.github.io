<h2>2013 -> 2016</h2>


I graduated with a ***Master's Degree in Engineering and Management of Complex Systems (EMACS)*** - option ***Design and management of complex systems*** from [IMT Mines Alès](https://www.mines-ales.fr/) in 2016.

It consists on depth study of methods and techniques for solving complex problems through the use of data science and computer techniques capable of simulating certain aspects of human intelligence.
